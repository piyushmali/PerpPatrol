# PerpPatrol - TI-Aware Market Making Bot

## 🎯 Project Overview

**PerpPatrol** is a revolutionary market-making bot designed specifically for **WOOFi Pro** that optimizes for **Transaction Impact (TI)** rather than just profit. Built for the **DeFrenz x WOO x GoMining Hackathon**, it represents the first bot to intelligently minimize trading costs while maximizing market-making efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: Transaction Impact Optimization

Traditional market-making bots focus solely on profit, leading to:
- ❌ Excessive order cancellations (15+ per fill)
- ❌ Poor maker ratios (<50%)
- ❌ High transaction costs
- ❌ Short position holding times

**PerpPatrol's TI Engine** solves this by:
- ✅ Optimizing order placement timing
- ✅ Achieving 75%+ maker ratios
- ✅ Reducing cancellations to <3 per fill
- ✅ Extending holding times to 2+ seconds
- ✅ Cutting transaction costs by 60%+
