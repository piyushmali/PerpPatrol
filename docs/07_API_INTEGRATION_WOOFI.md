# WOOFi Integration

`execution/woofi_client.py` defines the client surface:
- REST: place/cancel/replace orders; fetch balances/positions; funding & symbols.
- WS: order book snapshots & deltas; user fills/positions; heartbeats.

Fill in endpoint paths, auth headers, and field mappings per official docs.
